## Autonomous Mobile Robot for Grocery Delivery ðŸ¤–ðŸ›’

This project focuses on developing an **Autonomous Mobile Robot** for grocery delivery from **Rewe** to customers. The robot performs essential tasks such as object detection, obstacle avoidance, object tracking, path planning, and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) to navigate dynamic environments.

### Key Features
- **Object Detection & Avoidance**: Recognizes and avoids obstacles for safe navigation.
- **Object Tracking**: Identifies and follows key objects in the environment.
- **Path Planning & Motion Control**: Calculates optimal paths for efficient delivery.
- **SLAM**: Maps the environment while localizing itself in real time.

### Tools & Technologies
- **Software**: Python, PyTorch, OpenCV, ROS, MATLAB, and Simulink.
- **Hardware**: NVIDIA Jetson Nano, PID Controller, Sonar Sensor, IMU, GNSS, and Intel RealSense Depth Camera.

### Future Directions
Plans include enhanced obstacle detection, refined localization techniques, and expanded object tracking capabilities for real-world interactions.
